# Build Blockchain Insurance Application

This project showcases the use of blockchain in insurance domain for claim processing. In this application, we have four participants, namely insurance, police, repair shop and the shop. Furthermore,
each participant will own its own peer node. The insurance peer is the insurance company providing the insurance for the products and it is responsible for processing the claims. Police peer is responsible for verifying the theft claims. Repair shop peer is responsible for repairs of the product while shop peer sells the products to consumer. The value of running this network on the IBM Blockchain Platform is that 
you can easily customize the network infrastructure as needed, whether 
that is the location of the nodes, the CPU and RAM of the hardware, the
endorsement policy needed to reach consensus, or adding new organizations and members to the network.  

*Note:* This code pattern can either be run locally, or connected to the IBM Blockchain Platform. <b>If you only care 
about running this pattern locally, please find the local instructions [here](./README-local.md).</b>

Audience level : Intermediate Developers

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Create a Kubernetes Cluster using the IBM Kubernetes Service
* Create an IBM Blockchain service, and launch the service onto the Kubernetes cluster
* Create a network, including all relevant components, such as Certificate Authority, MSP (Membership Service Providers),
  peers, orderers, and channels.
* Deploy a packaged smart contract onto the IBM Blockchain Platform by installing and instantiating it on the peers.
* Use the connection profile from IBM Blockchain Platform to create application admins, and submit transactions from our 
client application.
* Configure a Db2 Federated Server to Access the Blockchain
* Query Blockchain via Zeppelin Notebooks using Db2 and SQL to perform analytics on blockchain transactions.
 

## Application Workflow Diagram
![Workflow](images/app-arch.png)

1. The blockchain operator creates a IBM Kubernetes Service cluster (<b>32CPU, 32RAM, 3 workers recommended</b>) and an IBM Blockchain 
Platform 2.0 service.
2. The IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 creates a Hyperledger Fabric network on an IBM Kubernetes 
Service, and the operator installs and instantiates the smart contract on the network.
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0.
4. The React UI uses the Node.js application API to interact and submit transactions to the network.
5. The user interacts with the insurance application web interface to update and query the blockchain ledger and state.

**Important Note:** This pattern is more advanced because it uses four organizations. For this reason, you will likely
have to get a paid kubernetes cluster to run this pattern on the cloud, since a free cluster will not have the CPU/storage 
necessary to deploy all of the pods that we need to run this pattern. There are other patterns that leverage a free
Kubernetes cluster (and only two organizations), so if you want to try that one out first, go [here](https://github.com/IBM/blockchainbean2). 

## Step 1. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes).  You can 
find the service in the `Catalog`. Note that <b>for this code pattern, we need to use the 32CPU, 32GB RAM cluster.</b>

* Once you reach the <b> create a new cluster page </b> you will need to do the following:
  - Choose <b>standard</b> cluster type
  - Fill out cluster name
  - choose Geography: <b>North America</b>
  - Choose Location and availability: <b>Multizone</b>
  - Choose Metro: <b>Dallas</b>
  - Choose Worker nodes: <b>Dallas 10 only</b>
  - Choose Master service endpoint: <b>Both private & public endpoints</b>
  - Choose Default worker pool: <b>1.12.7 (Stable, Default)</b>
  - Choose Master service endpoint: <b>Both private & public endpoints</b>
  - Choose Flavor <b>32 Cores 32GB RAM, Ubuntu 18</b>
  - Choose Encrypt local disk <b>Yes</b>
  - Choose Worker nodes <b>3</b>
  - Click on <b>create cluster. </b>
<b>The cluster takes around 15-20
minutes to provision, so please be patient!</b>

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/gifs/createCluster.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform V2 Beta on the cluster.  The service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/gifs/deploy-blockchain-on-cluster.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start operating on your blockchain network.

## Step 9. Enroll App Admin Identities

* #### Enroll insurnaceApp-admin
  - First, navigate to the `web/www/blockchain` directory.
    ```bash
    cd web/www/blockchain/
    ```
  - Open the `config.json` file, and update the caName with the URL 
    of the <b>insurance</b> certificate authority from your `ibpConnection.json` file. Save the file.  
  
  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
    ```bash
    node enrollAdmin.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user insuranceApp-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/gifs/enrollAdmin.gif">
</p>

* Enroll shopApp-admin
  - First, change the appAdmin, appAdminSecret, and caName properties in your `config.json` file, 
  so that it looks something like this (your caName should be different than mine):

    ```js
    {
        "connection_file": "ibpConnection.json",
        "appAdmin": "shopApp-admin",
        "appAdminSecret": "shopApp-adminpw",
        "orgMSPID": "shopmsp",
        "caName": "https://fa707c454921423c80ec3c3c38d7545c-caf2e287.horeainsurancetest.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:7054",
        "userName": "shopUser",
        "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
    }
    ```
  - To find the other CA urls, you will need to click on the `Nodes` tab in IBM Blockchain Platform, then on 
    the Shop CA, and on the settings cog icon at the top of the page. That will take you to the certificate 
    authority settings, as shown in the picture below, and you can copy that endpoint URL into your `config.json` **caName**
    field. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/gifs/enrollShopAdmin.gif">
</p>  
<br>

  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
    
    ```bash
    node enrollAdmin.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:

    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user shopApp-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```

* #### Enroll repairShopApp-admin (same process as shown in gif above)
  - First, change the appAdmin, appAdminSecret, and caName properties in your `config.json` file, 
  so that it looks something like this (your caName should be different than mine):

    ```js
    {
        "connection_file": "ibpConnection.json",
        "appAdmin": "repairShopApp-admin",
        "appAdminSecret": "repairShopApp-adminpw",
        "orgMSPID": "repairshopmsp",
        "caName": "https://fa707c454921423c80ec3c3c38d7545c-caf2e287.horeainsurancetest.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:7054",
        "userName": "repairUser",
        "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
    }
    ```
  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
      ```bash
      node enrollAdmin.js
      ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user repairShopApp-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```

* #### Enroll policeApp-admin (same process as shown in gif above)
  - First, change the appAdmin, appAdminSecret, and caName properties in your `config.json` file, 
  so that it looks something like this (your caName should be different than mine):

    ```js
    {
        "connection_file": "ibpConnection.json",
        "appAdmin": "policeApp-admin",
        "appAdminSecret": "policeApp-adminpw",
        "orgMSPID": "policemsp",
        "caName": "https://fa707c454921423c80ec3c3c38d7545c-caf2e287.horeainsurancetest.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:7054",
        "userName": "policeUser",
        "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
    }
    ```

  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
      ```bash
      node enrollAdmin.js
      ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
      ```bash
      msg: Successfully enrolled admin user policeApp-admin and imported it into the wallet
      ```
  
## Step 10. Run the application

Navigate to the root directory of the project:
  ```bash
  cd IBM-db2-blockchain-insurance-application
  ```

Login using your [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) credentials.
```bash
docker login
```

Run the build script to download and create docker images for the orderer, insurance-peer, police-peer, shop-peer, repairshop-peer, web application and certificate authorities for each peer. This will run for a few minutes.

For Mac user:
```bash
cd IBM-db2-blockchain-insurance-application
./build_mac.sh
```

For Ubuntu user:
```bash
cd IBM-db2-blockchain-insurance-application
./build_ubuntu.sh
```

You should see the following output on console:
```

**Wait for few minutes for application to install and instantiate the chaincode on network**

Check the status of installation using command:
```bash
docker logs web
```
On completion, you should see the following output on console:
```

### Setting up Db2 instance

In order to setup Db2 we will be using the zeppelin-notebook container, where Apache Zeppelin is setup and running, which is a web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. We will configure Apache Zeppelin to connect to Db2 instance.

We need to make sure the `db2-fabric` container is up and running. The container runs a lightweight community edition of Db2. You can execute `docker logs db2-fabric` to see the progress and status of the Db2 instance. You can keep executing this command to get the latest information for this container until you see:

`(*) All databases are now active. (*) Setup has completed.`

Once the installation is done, Lets setup the Db2 instance that was just created.
To setup we need to `exec` inside the `db2-fabric`. For this run: 

`docker exec -it db2-fabric bash`

You can then execute a setup script that sets some environment variables for DB2 and logging details. We then stop and start the database manager to pull in the latest configuration details. To do this run the following: 

```bash
su - db2inst1 -c '/db2-container/setup-instance.sh' && su - db2inst1 -c 'db2stop' && su - db2inst1 -c 'db2start'
``` 

### Sample Blockchain Insurance App Walkthrough

Use the link http://localhost:3000 to load the web application in browser.

The home page shows the participants (Peers) in the network. You can see that there is an Insurance, Repair Shop, Police and Shop Peer implemented. They are the participants of the network.

![Blockchain Insurance](images/home.png)

Imagine being a consumer (hereinafter called “Biker”) that wants to buy a phone, bike or Ski. By clicking on the “Go to the shop” section, you will be redirected to the shop (shop peer) that offers you the following products.

![Customer Shopping](images/Picture1.png)

You can see the three products offered by the shop(s) now. In addition, you have insurance contracts available for them. In our scenario, you are an outdoor sport enthusiast who wants to buy a new Bike. Therefore, you’ll click on the Bike Shop section.

![Shopping](images/Picture2.png)

In this section, you are viewing the different bikes available in the store. You can select within four different Bikes. By clicking on next you’ll be forwarded to the next page which will ask for the customer’s personal data.

![Bike Shop](images/Picture3.png)

You have the choice between different insurance contracts that feature different coverage as well as terms and conditions. You are required to type-in your personal data and select a start and end date of the contract. Since there is a trend of short-term or event-driven contracts in the insurance industry you have the chance to select the duration of the contract on a daily basis. The daily price of the insurance contract is being calculated by a formula that had been defined in the chaincode. By clicking on next you will be forwarded to a screen that summarizes your purchase and shows you the total sum.

![Bike Insurance](images/Picture4.png)

The application will show you the total sum of your purchase. By clicking on “order” you agree to the terms and conditions and close the deal (signing of the contract). In addition, you’ll receive a unique username and password. The login credentials will be used once you file a claim.  A block is being written to the Blockchain.

>note You can see the block by clicking on the black arrow on the bottom-right.

At this point, you should be able to go into your IBM Blockchain Platform console, click on the channels, and then 
be able to see the contract_create block being added. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/gifs/runAppIBP.gif">
</p>  
<br>

For additional steps on how to file more claims, and use the rest of the application, please go [here](./README-local.md).

Congratulations! You've successfully connection your React app to the IBM Blockchain Platform! Now each time you submit transactions with the UI, they will be logged by the blockchain service. 

### Configure a Federated Server to Access the Blockchain

To learn about Db2 federated server please follow [go here](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/db2/docs/content/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.data.fluidquery.doc/topics/cfpint23.html)

To setup the Db2 federated server, execute the following script in the `db2-fabric` container:

```bash
docker exec -it db2-fabric bash
su - db2inst1 -c "db2 connect to testdb && db2 -tvf /samples/insurance-setup.sql"
```

The SQL file located in the `./db2-fabric/db2-container/samples` directory titled `insurance-setup.sql` contains details on how the server is created.


### Manage Interpreter Settings in Zeppelin Notebook

Zeppelin notebook uses Db2 federated server and SQL to run queries on the blockchain network. We need to configure zeppelin interpreter details and specify Db2 connection parameters. Zeppelin Interpreter is the plug-in which enable zeppelin user to use a specific language/data-processing-backend. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` where the zeppelin-notebook is running.

![zeppelin notebook](images/zeppelin-notebook.png)

Select `Interpreter` from top right corner of the `Anonymous` user. We need to modify `jdbc` and `sh` settings.

![zeppelin notebook](images/interpreter.png)


#### Search `jdbc` from the text box and modify the following details:

![jdbc settings](images/jdbc-settings.png)

```bash
default.driver  -->  com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
default.url --> jdbc:db2://db2-fabric:50000/testdb
default.user --> db2inst1
default.password --> password
```
1.	`db2` is the relational database we are using
2.	`db2-fabric` is the name of the docker container that `db2` is running on
3.	`50000` is the open port we will be accessing
4.	`testdb` is the name of the database that we want to connect to

#### Search for `sh` from the text box and modify the following details: 

![sh settings](images/sh-settings.png)

```bash
shell.command.timeout.millisecs --> 600000
```
This will ensure that we won’t receive a timeout when executing a datagenerator job.

#### Db2 jar dependency
Also add the location of Db2 JDBC driver artifact under Dependencies. Add
`/opt/zeppelin/notebook/db2jcc.jar` in the text field and save.


### Generate Transactions on the Blockchain

Navigate to zeppelin UI using `http://localhost:8080`. Before we can analyze the Blockchain, we must first create a notebook and generate some demo data. Import notebook by clicking `import note` from zeppelin home page and upload the json file from your repository in location `zeppelin-notebook/notebook/Blockchain Demo.json`

Open the notebook by clicking the uploaded notebook from the home page. The first cell has command that identifies the private key used to connect to the Blockchain app and will set this in the properties file.

We have bundled together a data generator written in Java, and the next command will run the data generator job.

```bash
java -cp /opt/zeppelin/notebook/fabric-datagen-dependencies-1.0-DATAGEN.jar com.ibm.federation.datagen.GenerateTransactions --config-file=/opt/zeppelin/notebook/insurance.properties --datagen-type=insurance --flows=5 --attempts=100 --channel-name=default --chaincode-name=bcins seed-concurrent --threads=2
```

This data generator is compatible with other Blockchain applications so we must specify the type of blockchain to use. In this case, `datagen-type` should be set to `insurance`.

`Flows` refers to the various paths a customer can take based off the events that occur during the purchase of a product.

![Flows](images/flows.png)

From the Hyperledger Docs, A `channel` is defined as a private “subnet” of communication between two or more specific network members and we had configured the channel name to be `default`.

The `chaincode` name is defined as `bcins`

To generate transactions, select the first cell and click the `play` icon on the top right of the cell. Youc an then see transactions being generated on the blockchain by vieweing the Block explorer in the web app. There will be 50 transaction generated with 5 flows and this will take around 2 minutes to complete. 

![Generated transactions](images/generated-transactions.png)

With valid transactions being generated on the Blockchain, we can now query the Blockchain.

#### Query Blockchain via Zeppelin Notebooks using SQL

With configuration of the Federation server completed and transactions generated, we can now focus on analyzing the Blockchain. From the data analysts persona who works for insurance organization, we can anticipate 3 lines of business who would be interested in exploring different kinds of business insights from this network.

`Insurance Sales Reporting` focuses on analyzing the amount. Some insights can be:
1.	How many Contract were sold and over what period of time?
2.	What’s the policy purchase distribution over various dates/months?
3.	How much Revenue has been generated by selling policies in total or quarters?

`Insurance Claim Analysis`. Some insights can be:
1.	How many claims were filed for each product?
2.	What is the exposure for each product?

`Insurance Risk Analysis`. Some insights can be:
1.	What is the comparison between revenue vs claims paid?
2.	Are there any fraud claims that cannot be verified by police or theft?

We can start off by doing some basic exploration of data to see what we are dealing with.

Using the nickname `nn_tx `we had created for accessing transactions as local tables, we can execute a `select *` to get an understanding on this table.

Some noticeable columns to point out are 

```sql
ID: 
BLOCK_ORDINAL:
ORDINAL:
CHANNEL_ID:
CREATION_TIME:
CREATOR_MSPID
CREATOR_CERT
IS_VALID
VALIDATION_CODE
IS_TRANSACTION
SIGNATURE
CHAINCODE_ID:
ENDORSEMENT_CODE:
ARGS_COUNT:
```
In this blockchain application, there are three argument columns that we can use.

```
ARG_0 stores
ARG_1 stores
ARG_2 stores the business logic and is the most useful column that we can leverage
```

Here is an example of a JSON Payload with business details:

```json
{
   “contract_type_uuid":"17d773dc-2624-4c22-a478-87544dd0a17f",
   "username":"colin-bell-94@yahoo.com",
   "password":"",
   "first_name":"Colin",
   "last_name":"Bell",
   "item":{
      "id":1,
      "brand":"Apple",
      "model":"6",
      "price":630,
      "serial_no":"ZE5YYL"
   },
   "start_date":"2018-12-11T19:54:29.168Z",
   "end_date":"2018-12-23T01:40:20.736Z",
   "uuid":"3163b36c-0629-4974-bfbd-bdcb09f90a26"
}
```
For each insight there is a query you can run in the respective cell of the zeppelin notebook you have uploaded, to get the insight details.
